PBWT
C++ implementation of Algorithms 1 to 4 from the paper
Efficient haplotype matching and storage using the positional Burrows-Wheeler transform (PBWT)

by Richard Durbin, Bioinformatics

---

I implemented the Positional Burrows-Wheeler Transform (PBWT), an efficient algorithm for haplotype matching, storage, and retrieval in genomic data.
My implementation follows Durbins original paper very closely, replicating the logic for:

Algorithm 1: Building the prefix arrays (ak)
Algorithm 2: Building both prefix and divergence arrays (dk)
Algorithm 3: Reporting all haplotype matches longer than a threshold L
Algorithm 4: Reporting all set-maximal matches in linear time
